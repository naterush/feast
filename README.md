## Running Feast






## TODOS

1. Optimization. I want to time a set of 3 ingredients being added. Then I want to follow the core loop and see if we can reduce this time by 80%! This is what I will do next.
2. Specify and implement the editing functionality. You should just be able to change the ingredient at a specific index to a different ingredient (a dropdown, or something).
3. Then, running the first test tomorrow!

# Benchmark

1. 1min10seconds for 3 ingredients.
2. 41 seconds for 3 ingredients, after optimizing timeouts to backoff with a delay.
3. 34 seconds for 3 ingredients, after adding 5 tabs that can be searched at once.
4. 25 seconds for 3 ingredients, after optimizing the link searching. This is probably as quick as I can get it.
